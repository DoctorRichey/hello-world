# hello-world
New repository to learn the basics of working with GitHub 
I want to be an expert in everything but I end up being mediocre in just a few things.  I've wanted to learn to code so that I can build my own websites.  I've tried building websites back in college but they end up being super basic and have no functionality.  By day I am a pathologist.  By night I'm an "All-things-D" kind of guy, in other words, I understand and like to read about all things digital.
